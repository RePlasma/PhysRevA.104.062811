Abstract: _We estimate the energy distribution of positrons produced in the interaction of ultrarelativistic electrons with a high-intensity laser beam. The underlying trident process is factorized on the probabilistic level. That is, we deploy a two-step mechanism for the formation of electron-positron pairs. In the first step, a high-energy photon is produced as a result of nonlinear Compton scattering. In the second step, an electron-positron pair is created by the nonlinear (multiphoton) Breit-Wheeler process._
